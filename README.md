Color Detection Using Python and OpenCV:

This project allows for automatic color detection from images or live video feeds. It utilizes Python and the OpenCV library to detect and display the name of any color clicked in the image. The system works by converting the clicked pixel's color values into a name using predefined color ranges. This tool can be useful in various applications like graphic design, image editing, or any scenario where accurate color identification is required.

How It Works:
1.Click to Detect Color: Users can click on any point in an image or video stream. The program then captures the pixel's color values (in RGB format) and compares it against a pre-defined list of common color names.
2. Real-Time Detection: If you're using a live video stream (such as a webcam), the program will continuously display the detected color name as you move the cursor over the image or video.
3. Predefined Color Database: A set of common color names (such as Red, Green, Blue, etc.) is stored in the application. When a user clicks on a color, the RGB values are matched with the closest entry from the predefined list.

Key Features:
Real-Time Color Detection: Detect and name colors interactively by clicking on them in an image or video feed.
OpenCV-Based: Built with OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks, ensuring accurate color detection and a smooth user experience.
Simple and Intuitive: The app is easy to use—just click on any color within the image, and the app will tell you the name of the color.
Supports Multiple Formats: Works with various image formats such as PNG, JPG, and BMP, as well as real-time video feeds from a webcam.

How to Use:
Install Dependencies: First, make sure you have Python 3 and OpenCV installed.

Output: The color name will be displayed on the screen along with the RGB values of the selected pixel.

Sample Output:
Here’s an example of how the program works:

Future Enhancements:
Extended Color Database: Add more color names and ranges to increase the accuracy of detection.

Conclusion:
This Color Detection tool is a simple yet powerful application built using Python and OpenCV that helps users identify colors in real-time or from static images. Whether for design, analysis, or just for fun, this project is a great example of how Python can be used for computer vision tasks.
